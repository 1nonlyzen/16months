        <h1>Sixteen months of you and me</h1>
        <p class="fade-in">You and me, forever bound.<br>
        By gracious sacred love we found.<br>
        Everything stays by our side.</p>

        <p class="fade-in">In every moment, I find my place.<br>
        Each day with you, a perfect rhyme.<br>
        16 months, a dance in time.<br>
        Your laughter, love, your gentle grace.<br>
        My heart beats for you at ease.</p>

        <p class="fade-in">In endless love, there is pain,<br>
        But pain there is, we sought to fix.<br>
        In every fix, the more we love,<br>
        And rise above the stormy mix.</p>

        <p class="fade-in">For in each tear, we find our way,<br>
        Growing closer every day.<br>
        Through every trial, our love will stay,<br>
        A bond unbroken, come what may.</p>

        <p class="fade-in">In every glance, in every touch,<br>
        Youâ€™ve shown me love that means so much.<br>
        Sixteen months, and still I see,<br>
        Forever starts with you and me.</p>
